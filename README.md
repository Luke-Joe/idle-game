# Farming Simulator

## Project Proposal

The application is going to be a **clicker/idle game** that revolves around hitting minions. Defeating a minion gets you
gold which can be exchanged to add new champions and items to your arsenal that assist you in doing more damage to minions. 
As the game progresses, the minions health pool increase as well as the gold dropped. 

This is a game that could be used by *anyone* who has spare time.

The project is of interest to me as I want to develop games and clicker games have a significant playerbase while being relatively simple. 
I have also put my own spin on the genre by correlating it to minions, which I have a deep hatred for.
